## Customization

You can start editing the site by modifying `app/page.js` and the components within the `app/components/` and `app/sections/` directories. The page auto-updates as you edit files.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a custom font from Vercel.
